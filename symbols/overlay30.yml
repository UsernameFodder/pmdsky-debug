        Function responsible for writing dungeon data when quicksaving.
        
        Among other things, it contains a loop that goes through all the monsters in the current dungeon, copying their data to the buffer. The data is not copied as-is though, the game uses a reduced version of the monster struct containing only the minimum required data to resume the game later.
        
        r0: Pointer to buffer where data should be written
        r1: Buffer size. Seems to be 0x5800 (22 KB) when the function is called.
