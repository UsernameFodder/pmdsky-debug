    The dungeon engine.
    
    This is the "main" overlay of dungeon mode. It controls most things that happen in a Mystery Dungeon, such as dungeon layout generation, dungeon menus, enemy AI, and generally just running each turn while within a dungeon.

        Generates a seed with which to initialize the dungeon PRNG.
        
        The seed is calculated by starting with a different seed, the "preseed" x0 (defaults to 1, but can be set by other functions). The preseed is iterated twice with the same recurrence relation used in the primary LCG to generate two pseudorandom 32-bit numbers x1 and x2. The output seed is then computed as
          seed = (x1 & 0xFF0000) | (x2 >> 0x10) | 1
        The value x1 is then saved as the new preseed.
        
        This method of seeding the dungeon PRNG appears to be used only sometimes, depending on certain flags in the data for a given dungeon.

        Computes a pseudorandom 16-bit integer using the dungeon PRNG.
        
        Note that the dungeon PRNG is only used in dungeon mode (as evidenced by these functions being in overlay 29). The game uses another lower-quality PRNG (see arm9.yml) for other needs.
        
        Random numbers are generated with a linear congruential generator (LCG). The game actually maintains 6 separate sequences that can be used for generation: a primary LCG and 5 secondary LCGs. The generator used depends on parameters set on the global PRNG state.
        
        All dungeon LCGs have a modulus of 2^32 and a multiplier of 1566083941 (see DUNGEON_PRNG_LCG_MULTIPLIER). The primary LCG uses an increment of 1, while the secondary LCGs use an increment of 2531011 (see DUNGEON_PRNG_LCG_INCREMENT_SECONDARY). So, for example, the primary LCG uses the recurrence relation:
          x = (1566083941*x_prev + 1) % 2^32
        
        Since the dungeon LCGs generate 32-bit integers rather than 16-bit, the primary LCG yields 16-bit values by taking the upper 16 bits of the computed 32-bit value. The secondary LCGs yield 16-bit values by taking the lower 16 bits of the computed 32-bit value.
        
        All of the dungeon LCGs have a hard-coded default seed of 1, but in practice the seed is set with a call to InitDungeonRng during dungeon initialization.

        Very loosely speaking, this function first tries to generate a valid floor layout. Then it tries to spawn entities in a valid configuration. Finally, it performs cleanup and post-processing depending on the dungeon.
        
        If a spawn configuration is invalid, the entire floor layout is scrapped and regenerated. If the generated floor layout is invalid 10 times in a row, or a valid spawn configuration isn't generated within 10 attempts, the generation algorithm aborts and the default one-room Monster House floor is generated as a fallback.

        Randomly assigns connections between adjacent grid cells.
        
        Connections are created via a random walk with momentum, starting from the grid cell at (cursor x, cursor y). A connection is drawn in a random direction from the current cursor, and this process is repeated a certain number of times (the "floor connectivity" specified in the floor properties). The direction of the random walk has "momentum"; there's a 50% chance it will be the same as the previous step (or rotated counterclockwise if on the boundary). This helps to reduce the number of dead ends and forks in the road caused by the random walk "doubling back" on itself.
        
        If dead ends are disabled in the floor properties, there is an additional phase to remove dead end hallway anchors (only hallway anchors, not rooms) by drawing additional connections. Note that the actual implementation contains a bug: the grid cell validity checks use the wrong index, so connections may be drawn to invalid cells.

        Create grid cell connections either by creating hallways or merging rooms.
        
        When creating a hallway connecting a hallway anchor, the exact anchor coordinates are used as the endpoint. When creating a hallway connecting a room, a random point on the room edge facing the hallway is used as the endpoint. The grid cell boundaries are used as the middle coordinates for kinks (see CreateHallway).
        
        If room merging is enabled, there is a 9.75% chance that two connected rooms will be merged into a single larger room (9.75% comes from two 5% rolls, one for each of the two rooms being merged). A room can only participate in a merge once.

        If the two points share no coordinates in common (meaning the line connecting them is diagonal), a "kinked" hallway is created, with the kink at a specified "middle" coordinate (in practice the grid cell boundary). For example, with a kinked horizontal hallway, there are two horizontal lines extending out from the endpoints, connected by a vertical line on the middle x coordinate.
        
        If a hallway would intersect with an existing open tile (like an existing hallway), the hallway will only be created up to the point where it intersects with the open tile.

        Finalizes junction tiles by setting the junction flag (bit 3 of the terrain flags) and ensuring open terrain.
        
        Note that this implementation is slightly buggy. This function scans tiles left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and identifies junctions as any open, non-hallway tile (room_index != 0xFF) adjacent to an open, hallway tile (room_index == 0xFF). This interacts poorly with hallway anchors (room_index == 0xFE). This function sets the room index of any hallway anchors to 0xFF within the same loop, so a hallway anchor may or may not be identified as a junction depending on the orientation of connected hallways.
        
        For example, in the following configuration, the "o" tile would be marked as a junction because the neighboring hallway tile to its left comes earlier in iteration, while the "o" tile still has the room index 0xFE, causing the algorithm to mistake it for a room tile:
          xxxxx
          ---ox
          xxx|x
          xxx|x
        However, in the following configuration, the "o" tile would NOT be marked as a junction because it comes earlier in iteration than any of its neighboring hallway tiles, so its room index is set to 0xFF before it can be marked as a junction. This is actually the ONLY possible configuration where a hallway anchor will not be marked as a junction.
          xxxxx

        An array mapping each direction index to its x and y displacements.
        
        Directions start with 0=down and proceed counterclockwise (see enum direction_id). Displacements for x and y are interleaved and encoded as 2-byte signed integers. For example, the first two integers are [0, 1], which correspond to the x and y displacements for the "down" direction (positive y means down).

        An array mapping each (corner index, neighbor direction index) to whether or not that neighbor is expected to be open floor.
        
        Corners start with 0=top-left and proceed clockwise. Directions are enumerated as with DIRECTIONS_XY. The array is indexed by i=(corner_index * N_DIRECTIONS + direction). An element of 1 (0) means that starting from the specified corner of a room, moving in the specified direction should lead to an open floor tile (non-open terrain like a wall).
        
        Note that this array is only used for the cardinal directions. The elements at odd indexes are unused and unconditionally set to 0.
        
        This array is used by the dungeon generation algorithm when generating room imperfections. See GenerateRoomImperfections.
