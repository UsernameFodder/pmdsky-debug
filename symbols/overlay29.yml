      description: |-
        Generates a seed with which to initialize the PRNG.
        
        The seed is calculated by starting with a different seed, the "preseed" x0 (defaults to 1, but can be set by other functions). The preseed is iterated twice with the same recurrence relation used in the primary LCG to generate two pseudorandom 32-bit numbers x1 and x2. The output seed is then computed as
          seed = (x1 & 0xFF0000) | (x2 >> 0x10) | 1
        The value x1 is then saved as the new preseed.
        
        This method of seeding the PRNG appears to be used only sometimes, depending on certain flags in the data for a given dungeon.

      description: |-
        Computes a pseudorandom 16-bit integer.
        
        Random numbers are generated with a linear congruential generator (LCG). The game actually maintains 6 separate sequences that can be used for generation: a primary LCG and 5 secondary LCGs. The generator used depends on parameters set on the global PRNG state.
        
        All LCGs have a modulus of 2^32 and a multiplier of 1566083941 (see PRNG_LCG_MULTIPLIER). The primary LCG uses an increment of 1, while the secondary LCGs use an increment of 2531011 (see PRNG_LCG_INCREMENT_SECONDARY). So, for example, the primary LCG uses the recurrence relation:
          x = (1566083941*x_prev + 1) % 2^32
        
        Since the LCGs generate 32-bit integers rather than 16-bit, the primary LCG yields 16-bit values by taking the upper 16 bits of the computed 32-bit value. The secondary LCGs yield 16-bit values by taking the lower 16 bits of the computed 32-bit value.
        
        All of the LCGs have a hard-coded default seed of 1, but in practice the seed is set with a call to InitRng during dungeon initialization.

        Randomly assigns connections between adjacent grid cells.
        
        Connections are created via a random walk with momentum, starting from the grid cell at (cursor x, cursor y). A connection is drawn in a random direction from the current cursor, and this process is repeated a certain number of times (the "floor connectivity" specified in the floor properties). The direction of the random walk has "momentum"; there's a 50% chance it will be the same as the previous step (or rotated counterclockwise if on the boundary). This helps to reduce the number of dead ends and forks in the road caused by the random walk "doubling back" on itself.
        
        If dead ends are disabled in the floor properties, there is an additional phase to remove dead end hallway anchors (only hallway anchors, not rooms) by drawing additional connections. Note that the actual implementation contains a bug: the grid cell validity checks use the wrong index, so connections may be drawn to invalid cells.

        Finalizes junction tiles by setting the junction flag (bit 3 of the terrain flags) and ensuring open terrain.
        
        Note that this implementation is slightly buggy. This function scans tiles left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and identifies junctions as any open, non-hallway tile (room_index != 0xFF) adjacent to an open, hallway tile (room_index == 0xFF). This interacts poorly with hallway anchors (room_index == 0xFE). This function sets the room index of any hallway anchors to 0xFF within the same loop, so a hallway anchor may or may not be identified as a junction depending on the orientation of connected hallways.
        
        For example, in the following configuration, the "o" tile would be marked as a junction because the neighboring hallway tile to its left comes earlier in iteration, while the "o" tile still has the room index 0xFE, causing the algorithm to mistake it for a room tile:
          xxxxx
          ---ox
          xxx|x
          xxx|x
        However, in the following configuration, the "o" tile would NOT be marked as a junction because it comes earlier in iteration than any of its neighboring hallway tiles, so its room index is set to 0xFF before it can be marked as a junction. This is actually the ONLY possible configuration where a hallway anchor will not be marked as a junction.

        Generate a maze room within a given grid cell.
        
        A "maze" is generated within the room using a series of random walks to place obstacle terrain (walls or secondary terrain) in a maze-like arrangement. "Maze lines" (see GenerateMazeLine) are generated using every other tile around the room's border, as well as every other interior tile, as a starting point. This ensures that there are stripes of walkable open terrain surrounded by stripes of obstacles (the maze walls).

        Most entities are spawned randomly on a subset of permissible tiles.
        
        Stairs are spawned if they don't already exist on the floor, and hidden stairs of the specified type are also spawned if configured as long as there are at least 2 floors left in the dungeon. Stairs can spawn on any tile that has open terrain, is in a room, isn't in a Kecleon shop, doesn't already have an enemy spawn, isn't a hallway junction, and isn't a special tile like a Key door.
        
        Items are spawned both normally in rooms, as well as in walls and Monster Houses. Normal items can spawn on any tile that has open terrain, is in a room, isn't in a Kecleon shop or Monster House, isn't a hallway junction, and isn't a special tile like a Key door. Buried items can spawn on any wall tile. Monster House items can spawn on any Monster House tile that isn't in a Kecleon shop and isn't a hallway junction.
        
        Traps are similarly spawned both normally in rooms, as well as in Monster Houses. Normal traps can spawn on any tile that has open terrain, is in a room, isn't in a Kecleon shop, doesn't already have an item or enemy spawn, and isn't a special tile like a Key door. Monster House traps follow the same conditions as Monster House items.
        
        The player can spawn on any tile that has open terrain, is in a room, isn't in a Kecleon shop, isn't a hallway junction, doesn't already have an item, enemy, or trap spawn, and isn't a special tile like a Key door.

        Rivers are generated by a top-down or bottom-up random walk that ends when existing secondary terrain is reached or the walk goes out of bounds. Some rivers also end prematurely in a lake. Lakes are a large collection of secondary terrain generated around a central point.

        This appears to be the top-level function for running dungeon mode.
        
        It gets called by some code in overlay 10 right after doing the dungeon fade transition, and once it exits, the dungeon results are processed.
        
        This function is presumably in charge of allocating the dungeon struct, setting it up, launching the dungeon engine, etc.
