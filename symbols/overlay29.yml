        The game uses various placeholder tags in its strings, which you can read about here: https://textbox.skytemple.org/.

        Just a guess. This appears to be paired often with GetEffectAnimationField0x19, and also has calls AnimationHasMoreFrames in a loop alongside AdvanceFrame(66) calls.

        This function processes the monster spawn list of the current floor, checking which species can spawn, capping the amount of spawnable species on the floor to 14, randomly choosing which 14 species will spawn and ensuring that the sprite size of all the species combined does not exceed the maximum of 0x58000 bytes (352 KB). Kecleon and the Decoy are always included in the random selection.
        The function also processes the floor's item spawn lists. When loading fixed rooms from the hidden staircase, the game forces the number of spawnable species to 0.

        The seed is calculated by starting with a different seed, the "preseed" x0 (defaults to 1, but can be set by other functions). The preseed is iterated twice with the same recurrence relation used in the primary LCG to generate two pseudorandom 32-bit numbers x1 and x2. The output seed is then computed as
          seed = (x1 & 0xFF0000) | (x2 >> 0x10) | 1

        Computes a pseudorandom 16-bit integer using the dungeon PRNG.
        
        Note that the dungeon PRNG is only used in dungeon mode (as evidenced by these functions being in overlay 29). The game uses another lower-quality PRNG (see arm9.yml) for other needs.
        
        Random numbers are generated with a linear congruential generator (LCG). The game actually maintains 6 separate sequences that can be used for generation: a primary LCG and 5 secondary LCGs. The generator used depends on parameters set on the global PRNG state.
        
        All dungeon LCGs have a modulus of 2^32 and a multiplier of 1566083941 (see DUNGEON_PRNG_LCG_MULTIPLIER). The primary LCG uses an increment of 1, while the secondary LCGs use an increment of 2531011 (see DUNGEON_PRNG_LCG_INCREMENT_SECONDARY). So, for example, the primary LCG uses the recurrence relation:
          x = (1566083941*x_prev + 1) % 2^32
        
        Since the dungeon LCGs generate 32-bit integers rather than 16-bit, the primary LCG yields 16-bit values by taking the upper 16 bits of the computed 32-bit value. The secondary LCGs yield 16-bit values by taking the lower 16 bits of the computed 32-bit value.
        
        All of the dungeon LCGs have a hard-coded default seed of 1, but in practice the seed is set with a call to InitDungeonRng during dungeon initialization.

        The damage calculation function.
        
        At a high level, the damage formula is:
          M * [(153/256)*(A + P) - 0.5*D + 50*ln(10*[L + (A - D)/8 + 50]) - 311]
        where:
          - A is the offensive stat (attack or special attack) with relevant modifiers applied (stat stages, certain items, certain abilities, etc.)
          - D is the defensive stat (defense or special defense) with relevant modifiers applied (stat stages, certain items, certain abilities, etc.)
          - L is the attacker's level
          - P is the move power with relevant modifiers applied
          - M is an aggregate damage multiplier from a variety of things, such as type-effectiveness, STAB, critical hits (which are also rolled in this function), certain items, certain abilities, certain statuses, etc.
        
        The calculations are done primarily with 64-bit fixed point arithmetic, and a bit of 32-bit fixed point arithmetic. There's also rounding/truncation/clamping at various steps in the process.

        The AI uses this function to check if a move has any potential targets, to calculate the list of potential targets and to calculate the move's special weight.
        This weight will be higher if the pokémon has weak-type picker and the target is weak to the move (allies only, enemies always get a result of 1 even if the move is super effective). More things could affect the result.
        This function also sets the flag can_be_used on the ai_possible_move struct if it makes sense to use it.
        More research is needed. There's more documentation about this special weight. Does all the documented behavior happen in this function?

        Very loosely speaking, this function first tries to generate a valid floor layout. Then it tries to spawn entities in a valid configuration. Finally, it performs cleanup and post-processing depending on the dungeon.
        
        If a spawn configuration is invalid, the entire floor layout is scrapped and regenerated. If the generated floor layout is invalid 10 times in a row, or a valid spawn configuration isn't generated within 10 attempts, the generation algorithm aborts and the default one-room Monster House floor is generated as a fallback.

        Try to generate secondary structures in flagged rooms.
        
        If a valid room with no special features is flagged to have a secondary structure, try to generate a random one in the room, based on the result of a dice roll:
          0: no secondary structure
          1: maze, or a central water/lava "plus sign" as fallback, or a single water/lava tile in the center as a second fallback
          2: checkerboard pattern of water/lava
          3: central pool of water/lava
          4: central "island" with items and a Warp Tile, surrounded by a "moat" of water/lava
          5: horizontal or vertical divider of water/lava splitting the room in two
        
        If the room isn't the right shape, dimension, or otherwise doesn't support the selected secondary structure, it is left untouched.

        Randomly assigns connections between adjacent grid cells.
        
        Connections are created via a random walk with momentum, starting from the grid cell at (cursor x, cursor y). A connection is drawn in a random direction from the current cursor, and this process is repeated a certain number of times (the "floor connectivity" specified in the floor properties). The direction of the random walk has "momentum"; there's a 50% chance it will be the same as the previous step (or rotated counterclockwise if on the boundary). This helps to reduce the number of dead ends and forks in the road caused by the random walk "doubling back" on itself.
        
        If dead ends are disabled in the floor properties, there is an additional phase to remove dead end hallway anchors (only hallway anchors, not rooms) by drawing additional connections. Note that the actual implementation contains a bug: the grid cell validity checks use the wrong index, so connections may be drawn to invalid cells.

        Finalizes junction tiles by setting the junction flag (bit 3 of the terrain flags) and ensuring open terrain.
        
        Note that this implementation is slightly buggy. This function scans tiles left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and identifies junctions as any open, non-hallway tile (room_index != 0xFF) adjacent to an open, hallway tile (room_index == 0xFF). This interacts poorly with hallway anchors (room_index == 0xFE). This function sets the room index of any hallway anchors to 0xFF within the same loop, so a hallway anchor may or may not be identified as a junction depending on the orientation of connected hallways.
        
        For example, in the following configuration, the "o" tile would be marked as a junction because the neighboring hallway tile to its left comes earlier in iteration, while the "o" tile still has the room index 0xFE, causing the algorithm to mistake it for a room tile:
          xxxxx
          ---ox
          xxx|x
          xxx|x
        However, in the following configuration, the "o" tile would NOT be marked as a junction because it comes earlier in iteration than any of its neighboring hallway tiles, so its room index is set to 0xFF before it can be marked as a junction. This is actually the ONLY possible configuration where a hallway anchor will not be marked as a junction.
          xxxxx

        Corners start with 0=top-left and proceed clockwise. Directions are enumerated as with DIRECTIONS_XY. The array is indexed by i=(corner_index * N_DIRECTIONS + direction). An element of 1 (0) means that starting from the specified corner of a room, moving in the specified direction should lead to an open floor tile (non-open terrain like a wall).
        
        Note that this array is only used for the cardinal directions. The elements at odd indexes are unused and unconditionally set to 0.

        [Runtime] Pointer to the dungeon struct in dungeon mode.
        
        This is a "master copy" of the dungeon pointer. The game uses this pointer when doing low-level memory work (allocation, freeing, zeroing). The normal DUNGEON_PTR is used for most other dungeon mode work.

        [Runtime] The global PRNG state for dungeon mode, not including the current values in the secondary sequences.
        
        This struct holds state for the primary LCG, as well as the current configuration controlling which LCG to use when generating random numbers. See DungeonRand16Bit for more information on how the dungeon PRNG works.

        Based on the assembly, this appears to be its own global array, separate from DUNGEON_PRNG_STATE.

        This is just a struct full of zeroes, but is used as a fallback in various places where a "default" tile is needed, such as when a grid index is out of range.

        [Runtime] A flag for when Hidden Stairs could normally have spawned on the floor but didn't.
        
        This is set either when the Hidden Stairs just happen not to spawn by chance, or when the current floor is a rescue or mission destination floor.
        
        This appears to be part of a larger (8-byte?) struct. It seems like this value is at least followed by 3 bytes of padding and a 4-byte integer field.
