    The main ARM9 binary.
    
    This is the binary that gets loaded when the game is launched, and contains the core code that runs the game, low level facilities such as memory allocation, compression, other external dependencies (such as linked functions from libc and libgcc), and the functions and tables necessary to load overlays and dispatch execution to them.

        The implementation for MemAlloc.
        
        At a high level, memory is allocated by choosing a memory arena, looking through blocks in the memory arena until a free one that's large enough is found, then splitting off a new memory block of the needed size.
        
        This function is not fallible, i.e., it hangs the whole program on failure, so callers can assume it never fails.
        
        The name for this function comes from the error message logged on failure, and it reflects what the function does: locate an available block of memory and set it up for the caller.
        
        r0: desired memory arena for allocation, or null (MemAlloc passes null)

        The implementation for MemFree.
        
        At a high level, memory is freed by locating the pointer in its memory arena (searching block-by-block) and emptying the block so it's available for future allocations, and merging it with neighboring blocks if they're available.
        
        r0: desired memory arena for freeing, or null (MemFree passes null)

        The actual memory-setting implementation for the memset(3) C library function.
        
        This function is optimized to set bytes in 4-byte chunks for n >= 32, correctly handling any unaligned bytes at the front/back. In this case, it also further optimizes by unrolling a for loop to set 8 4-byte values at once (effectively a 32-byte chunk).
