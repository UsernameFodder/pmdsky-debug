    The main ARM9 binary.
    
    This is the main binary that gets loaded when the game is launched, and contains the core code that runs the game, low level facilities such as memory allocation, compression, other external dependencies (such as linked functions from libc and libgcc), and the functions and tables necessary to load overlays and dispatch execution to them.
    
    Speaking generally, this is the program run by the Nintendo DS's main ARM946E-S CPU, which handles all gameplay mechanisms and graphics rendering.

        Dungeon mode uses the default arena getters.

Note that the sound memory arena is provided explicitly to MemLocateSet in the sound code, so doesn't go through this path.

        The implementation for MemAlloc.
        
        At a high level, memory is allocated by choosing a memory arena, looking through blocks in the memory arena until a free one that's large enough is found, then splitting off a new memory block of the needed size.
        
        This function is not fallible, i.e., it hangs the whole program on failure, so callers can assume it never fails.
        
        The name for this function comes from the error message logged on failure, and it reflects what the function does: locate an available block of memory and set it up for the caller.
        
        r0: desired memory arena for allocation, or null (MemAlloc passes null)

      description: |-
        The implementation for MemFree.
        
        At a high level, memory is freed by locating the pointer in its memory arena (searching block-by-block) and emptying the block so it's available for future allocations, and merging it with neighboring blocks if they're available.
        
        r0: desired memory arena for freeing, or null (MemFree passes null)

        The constant shift applied to the overall output of the "unshifted base" damage formula (the sum of the scaled AT, DEF, and ClampedLn terms), as a binary fixed-point number with 8 fraction bits (-311).
        
        The value of -311 is notably equal to -round[DAMAGE_FORMULA_LN_PREFACTOR * ln(DAMAGE_FORMULA_LN_ARG_PREFACTOR * DAMAGE_FORMULA_FLV_SHIFT)]. This is probably not a coincidence.

        Interleaved table of sine and cosine values at 4096 divisions over a full period (2π radians).
        
        More precisely, the trig_values entry at index i corresponds to {sin(i * 2π/4096), cos(i * 2π/4096)} (each division is ~1/10 of a degree). Values are stored as signed fixed-point numbers with 12 fraction bits.
