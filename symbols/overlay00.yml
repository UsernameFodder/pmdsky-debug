  description: |-
    Likely contains supporting data and code related to the top menu.
    
    This is loaded together with overlay 1 while in the top menu. Since it's in overlay group 2 (together with overlay 10, which is another "data" overlay), this overlay probably plays a similar role. It mentions several files from the BACK folder that are known backgrounds for the top menu.
