    The script engine.
    
    This is the "main" overlay of ground mode. The script engine is what runs the ground mode scripts contained in the SCRIPT folder, which are written in a custom scripting language. These scripts encode things like cutscenes, screen transitions, ground mode events, and tons of other things related to ground mode.

        Each entry is 16 bytes, consisting of:
        - overlay group ID (see arm9.yml or enum overlay_group_id in the C headers for a mapping between group ID and overlay number)
        - function pointer to entry point
        - function pointer to destructor
        - possibly function pointer to frame-update function?
