    The script engine.
    
    This is the "main" overlay of ground mode. The script engine is what runs the ground mode scripts contained in the SCRIPT folder, which are written in a custom scripting language. These scripts encode things like cutscenes, screen transitions, ground mode events, and tons of other things related to ground mode.

        Unlocks a scripting lock.
        
        Sets the corresponding byte to 1 on LOCK_NOTIFY_ARRAY to signal that the scripting engine should handle the unlock. Also sets a global unlock flag, used to tell the scripting engine that the state of locks have changed and they should be checked again.

        Checks if a script unlock happened by reading entries from LOCK_NOTIFY_ARRAY and handles the ones that were set.
        
        If the global unlock flag is not set, returns immediately. If it is, the function loops LOCK_NOTIFY_ARRAY, checking for true values. If it finds one, resets it back to 0 and handles the unlock.

        Converts the given opcode parameter to a signed integer.
        
        The parameter will be returned unchanged unless one of its two most significant bits (0x8000 and 0x4000) are set, in which case both bits will be cleared and the original value will be modified according to the following two rules:
        - If the 0x4000 bit is set (sign bit), the value will be set to -16384 + value.
        - If the 0x8000 bit is set (fixed-point flag), the value will be set to value / 256, rounded down.
        Both rules can be applied, in the same order as listed, if both conditions are met.

        Converts the given opcode parameter to a 16-bit signed fixed-point number with 8 fraction bits.
        
        The resulting number is encoded as (value) * 256, with the last byte acting as a fraction byte capable of representing multiples of 1/256.
        
        The parameter will either be returned unchanged or modified depending on which of its two most significant bits (0x8000 and 0x4000) are set. Both bits are unset before running the operations listed below:
        - If the 0x4000 bit is set (sign bit), the value will be set to -16384 + value.
        - If the 0x8000 bit is set (fixed-point flag), the raw value is interpreted as being fixed-point already, and nothing else happens. Otherwise, it's assumed to be a normal integer and is converted to fixed-point by left-shifting it by 8 (moving the integer part to its proper place).
        Both rules can be applied, in the same order as listed, if both conditions are met.
