        Called when the in-dungeon "team" menu is open. Does not return until the menu is closed.
        
        Note that selecting certain options in this menu (such as viewing the details or the moves of a pok√©mon) counts as switching to a different menu, which causes the function to return.

      description: |-
        Called on each frame while the in-dungeon "recruitment search" menu is open.
        
        return: int (Actually, this is probably some sort of enum shared by all the MenuLoop functions)
    - name: HelpMenuLoop

      description: |-
        Called on each frame while the in-dungeon "help" menu is open.
        
        The menu is still considered open while one of the help pages is being viewed, so this function keeps being called even after choosing an option.
        
        return: int (Actually, this is probably some sort of enum shared by all the MenuLoop functions)
