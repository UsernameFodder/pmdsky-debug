        Creates a window containing a menu for inventory management. Also see struct inventory_menu.
        
        This is used for the Treasure Bag menu, the item information/price window in dungeon Kecleon shops, and possibly other things.
        
        If window_params is NULL, INVENTORY_MENU_DEFAULT_WINDOW_PARAMS will be used. Otherwise, it will be copied onto the window, ignoring the update and contents fields. If window_params::width and/or window_params::height are 0, they will be computed based on the contained text.
        
        If window_extra_info is non-NULL, it will be copied onto the window. Note that window_extra_info can only be NULL if there are no window_flags set that require extra info.
