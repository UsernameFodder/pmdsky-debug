    The instruction TCM (tightly-coupled memory) and the corresponding region in the ARM9 binary.
    
    The ITCM is a special area of low-latency memory meant for performance-critical routines. It's similar to an instruction cache, but more predictable. See the ARMv5 Architecture Reference Manual, Chapter B7 (https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0100/i).
    
    The Nintendo DS ITCM region is located at 0x0-0x7FFF in memory, but the 32 KiB segment is mirrored throughout the 16 MiB block from 0x0-0x1FFFFFF. The Explorers of Sky code seems to reference only the mirror at 0x1FF8000, the closest one to main memory.
    
    In Explorers of Sky, a fixed region of the ARM9 binary appears to be loaded in the ITCM at all times, and seems to contain functions related to the dungeon AI, among other things. The ITCM has a max capacity of 0x8000, although not all of it is used.

        Called whenever a hardware interrupt takes place.
        
        Returns immediately if the IME flag is 0 or if none of the devices that requested an interrupt has the corresponding Interrupt Enable flag set.
        It searches for the first device that requested an interrupt, clears its Interrupt Request flag, then jumps to the start of the corresponding interrupt function. The return address is manually set to ReturnFromInterrupt.
        The address of the function to jump to is read from the interrupt vector at the start of the DTCM region (0x27E0000).

        [Runtime] Keeps track of all active heap allocations.
        
        The memory allocator in the ARM9 binary uses region-based memory management (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management). The heap is broken up into smaller contiguous chunks called arenas (struct mem_arena), which are in turn broken up into chunks referred to as blocks (struct mem_block). Most of the time, an allocation results in a block being split off from a free part of an existing memory arena.
