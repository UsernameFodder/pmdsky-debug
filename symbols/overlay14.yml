        Run the minigame according to the current game state, or handle the transition to a new state if one has been set.
        
        The game is implemented using the state machine programming pattern. This function appears to contain the top-level code for running a single "turn" of the state machine, although presumably there's a higher level game engine that's calling this function in a loop somewhere.
        
        return: return code for the engine driving the minigame? Seems like 1 to keep going and 4 to stop
