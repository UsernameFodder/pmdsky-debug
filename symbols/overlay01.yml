    Likely controls the top menu.
    
    This is loaded together with overlay 0 while in the top menu. Since it's in overlay group 1 (together with other "main" overlays like overlay 11 and overlay 29), this is probably the controller.
    
    Seems to contain code related to Wi-Fi rescue. It mentions several files from the GROUND and BACK folders.
