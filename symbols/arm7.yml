    The ARM7 binary.
    
    This is the secondary binary that gets loaded when the game is launched.
    
    Speaking generally, this is the program run by the Nintendo DS's secondary ARM7TDMI CPU, which handles the audio I/O, the touch screen, Wi-Fi functions, cryptography, and more.
    
    Memory map: (binary is initially loaded at 0x2380000)
    0x2380000-0x23801E8 => Contains _start_arm7 and two more methods, all related to memory mapping.
    0x23801E8-0x238F7F0 => Mapped to 0x37F8000, contains NitroSpMain and functions crucial to execution.
    0x238F7F0-0x23A7068 => Mapped to 0x27E0000, contains everything else that won't fit in the fast WRAM.
    
    Note that while the length for the main EU/NA/JP block is defined as 0x27080 above, after memory mappings, the block located at that address is only a 0x1E8 long ENTRY block, containing 3 functions solely used for the initial memory mapping. The memory following this block is reused and its purpose is undocumented at the moment.
  functions:
    - name: _start_arm7

        The entrypoint for the ARM7 CPU.
        
        Handles mapping the ARM7 binary into the various memory areas that the program will be using.
        
        Once the memory mapping has been completed, a constant containing the address to NitroSpMain is loaded into a register (r1), and a `bx` branch will jump to NitroSpMain.

        Called whenever a hardware interrupt takes place.
        
        Returns immediately if the IME flag is 0 or if none of the devices that requested an interrupt has the corresponding Interrupt Enable flag set.
        It searches for the first device that requested an interrupt, clears its Interrupt Request flag, then jumps to the start of the corresponding interrupt function. The return address is manually set to ReturnFromInterrupt.
        This function does not return.
        
        No params.

        Returns the time that the current song has been playing for. Might have a more generic purpose.
        
        The time is obtained using a couple of RAM counters and the hardware timers for additional precision.
        The game uses this value to know when a given note should stop being played. It doesn't seem to be used to keep track of the
        current time instant within the song.
        
        return: Playback time. Units unknown.
