    The ARM7 binary.
    
    This is the secondary binary that gets loaded when the game is launched.
    
    Speaking generally, this is the program run by the Nintendo DS's secondary ARM7TDMI CPU, which handles the audio I/O, the touch screen, Wi-Fi functions, cryptography, and more.
  functions:
    - name: EntryArm7
      address:
        EU: 0x2380000

        The entrypoint for the ARM7 CPU.
        
        Handles mapping the ARM7 binary into the various memory areas that the program will be using:

        Memory map: (binary is initially loaded at 0x2380000)
        0x2380000-0x23801E8 => Contains EntryArm7 and two more methods, all related to memory mapping.
        0x23801E8-0x238F7F0 => Mapped to 0x37F8000, contains MainArm7 and functions crucial to execution.
        0x238F7F0-0x23A7068 => Mapped to 0x27E0000, contains everything else that won't fit in the fast WRAM.
        
        No params.
