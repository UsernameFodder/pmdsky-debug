"""
`symbols_vfill.py` is a command line utility for filling in missing function
addresses in the pmdsky-debug symbol tables, for addresses that are known in
some game versions (e.g., NA, EU) but not in others.

When run, the program will modify the YAML symbol tables in-place (unless
dry-run mode is enabled). It is recommended that you commit any symbol table
changes that you are working on BEFORE running `symbols_vfill.py`. This will
allow you to inspect filled addresses with `git diff` (or similar), and will
also prevent you from losing your changes if something somehow goes wrong.

This program is conservative in the symbol addresses it fills in, and tries
hard to avoid adding incorrect addresses caused by spurious matches between
binary files. It uses the following strategies to this end:
    - Only filling in addresses for function symbols, not data symbols. Data
      symbols are very difficult to match automatically because the meaning
      of data symbols is largely context-dependent. This means that the
      contents of a data symbol are not necessarily unique: two different
      symbols might point to exactly the same binary data, and yet might have
      different semantic meanings depending on the context.
    - Skipping symbols with multiple addresses. These are difficult to match
      automatically for similar reasons to data symbols, even for functions.
    - Only filling in addresses where EXACTLY one match (based on assembly
      instructions) is found. If multiple matches are found, there is
      significant ambiguity as to whether all the matches actually correspond
      to the same function (e.g., veneers for different functions can
      have exactly matching assembly). If a function symbol's length is not
      known, symbols_vfill.py makes a guess for the length, and adaptively
      adjusts it until it leads to exactly one match (if possible).
    - Imposing a minimum instruction count on matches based on adaptive symbol
      length inference. By default, the inferred length will always be at least
      the length of 4 instructions.
    - By default (can be disabled), discarding inferred addresses that are out
      of order relative to existing addresses of neighboring functions.

Note that this program has a "fast mode", which can be enabled with the --fast
flag. The only thing this changes is the number of times the formatter is run.
As the name suggests, fast mode runs faster, and has no differences upon
successful completion of the program. However, this may leave the symbol table
files in a bad state if the program is terminated prematurely (such as from a
user interrupt).

This program requires cargo to be installed and available in the runtime
environment so that `resymgen` can be run.

Example usage:

python3 symbols_vfill.py -f \
    --dir-na </path/to/EoS_NA_unpacked_dir> \
    --dir-eu </path/to/EoS_EU_unpacked_dir>

python3 symbols_vfill.py -f --dry-run \
    --dir-na </path/to/EoS_NA_unpacked_dir> \
    --dir-eu </path/to/EoS_EU_unpacked_dir>
