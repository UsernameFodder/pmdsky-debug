"""
`symdiff.py` is a command line utility for comparing Git revisions of the
pmdsky-debug symbol tables. It will output a list of changes to the symbols in
a target revision relative to a base revision, possibly for a subset of symbol
files if specified.

Note that the focus is on symbols. Only material changes to the contents or
file locations of symbols will be reported; changes to block-level metadata
will not be reported unless they affect one or more symbols.

The diff algorithm tries to intelligently correlate symbols across revisions,
even if the names or addresses change. For the most part, this is a simple
one-to-one matching by address and/or name, but in the event of conflicts, the
following conflict-resolution procedure is followed:
    1. Give priority to better matches, defined by the number of matching
       addresses, and whether or not the symbol names match.
    2. If there are conflicting matches of the same quality, compute a maximum
       cardinality matching for the collection of symbols in contention.

By default, the `symdiff.py` will ignore certain "unimportant" changes to
symbols. This includes changes to symbol descriptions, and when symbols are
moved between subregions but kept within the same top-level block. These
changes can be included in the diff with the `--descriptions` and
`--subregion-resolution` flags, respectively.

Example usage:

python3 symdiff.py
python3 symdiff.py HEAD~5 HEAD~2 -- </path/to/arm9.yml> </path/to/overlay29.yml>
python3 symdiff.py -sdv <tag name, commit hash, or branch name>
