//! The `resymgen` YAML format and associated APIs to integrate with other data formats.
//!
//! [`SymGen`] represents an entire `resymgen` YAML file. Through this type and its methods,
//! `resymgen` files can be read from files, manipulated in various ways, and written to files.
//!
//! A `resymgen` YAML file consists of one or more named [`Block`]s. Each [`Block`] is tagged with
//! some metadata, and contains two lists of [`Symbol`]s, one for functions and one for data.
//! A [`Symbol`] represents one or more memory regions containing an identifiable chunk of
//! instructions or data.
//!
//! Optionally, each [`Block`] can also contain a list of [`Subregion`]s. A [`Subregion`]
//! represents a nested [`SymGen`], which has one or more of its own named [`Block`]s, that is
//! contained within the parent [`Block`]. In a `resymgen` YAML file, a [`Subregion`] is
//! represented as a file name. If the `resymgen` YAML file has the file path
//! `/path/to/parent.yml`, and one of its blocks has a subregion with the name `sub.yml`, then
//! this subregion name references a corresponding subregion file (which is itself a `resymgen`
//! YAML file) with the file path `/path/to/parent/sub.yml`.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```yml
//! main:
//!   versions:
//!     - v1
